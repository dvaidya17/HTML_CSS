@ In HTML structure, <!DOCTYPE html> is not a HTML element. It's a statement which tells the browser to use latest version of HTML. If we don't write this line then browser will use older version of HTML which won't support some features.
@ Genral HTML structure:-
<!DOCTYPE htm>
<html>
  <head> </head>
  <body> </body>
</html>

Here, all the things which are displayed on the webpage will come under body and rest everything will come under head.
<title> </title> :- Any thing return between this would be the name of the tab of the web page.

@ href -> path (may it be url, file path etc)
